# hand-gesture-music-controller
Hand Gesture Recognition Based Music Player Controller 

This is a simple Python project that lets you control any music player (like Spotify, VLC, or YouTube) using hand gestures detected via your webcam. 
It uses computer vision to recognize finger counts and maps them to media control actions like Play/Pause, Next, Previous, Volume Up, and Volume Down.
